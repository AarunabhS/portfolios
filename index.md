### Project Samples

[Google Merchandise Store Dashboard (Google Analytics, BigQuery, BI, Tableau)](https://public.tableau.com/profile/shuchang.liang#!/vizhome/GoogleAnalyticDashboard-GoogleMerchandiseStore/Dashboard)
-	Transformed large data from session and hit levels using Google BigQuery into a unnested, relational table (1.4-million records).
-	Built a dynamic KPI dashboard which displays monthly or yearly traffic (total sessions, average pageviews, average duration on page) per source and per location, acquisition amounts per channel, and bounce rate per page.

[Online Retailer Marketing Analysis (Machine Learning, Feature Engineering, Python)](https://github.com/shuchangliang/Projects/blob/master/LTV%20%26%20Predicting%20Next%20Purchase%20Day.ipynb)
-	Performed analysis using rollup and drill down, slice and dice, sort and rank on 1 year of historical sales data for a global online retailer to compare monthly performance (e.g., growth rate, numbers of active customers, new customer ratio and retention rate, etc.)
-	Performed SWOT analysis on consumer marketing initiatives.
-	Used Kmeans to segment customers into 3 clusters (high, medium and low value), based on their recency, frequency and monetary values.
-	Performed cohort analysis (retention over user & product lifetime) and customer lifetime value (LTV) analysis.
-	A GridSearchCV tuned Random Forest multi-class Classifier (84% accuracy) was implemented to predict the customerâ€™s LTV classes.

[Home Credit Default Risk Prediction (SQL, Machine Learning, Python)](https://github.com/shuchangliang/Projects/blob/master/Home%20Credit%20Default%20Risk.ipynb)
-	Calculated credit-to-income ratio, average income, numbers of bad debt and refused accounts, etc. for 300,000 records using SQL.
-	Prepared data by removing empty records and imputing missing values, and identified features correlated to defaulted accounts.
-	Transformed categorical variables into dummy variables using one-hot encoding.
-	Implemented and compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, the performance of the later method was improved by 17%.
