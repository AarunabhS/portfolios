[Retail Analytics (Power BI, Python)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunabho-kanti-som/details/projects/)
- The Adventure Works dataset analysis revealed that the most popular product categories are accessories, bikes, and clothing, generating a total of $23.6 million in revenue.
- Sales from online channels have shown a significant increase over the past year, with a 15% growth rate and a total of $5.8 million in revenue generated through this channel.
- The most profitable customer segments are from the Pacific region, generating a total of $6.2 million in revenue, followed by the South Atlantic and Mountain regions.
- A key finding from the analysis is that the company's marketing campaign focusing on discounting products has not been effective, as the revenue generated from discounted products only accounts for 7% of the total revenue. It may be more effective to focus on other marketing strategies to increase sales.
