[Loan Repayment Status Analytics and Insight (SQL, Machine Learning, Python (https://github.com/shuchangliang/Projects/blob/master/Home%20Credit%20Default%20Risk.ipynb)
-	Analyzed loan status over time, noting a lower quantity of write-offs and delinquent loans compared to current loans, indicating positive financial health.
-	Observed a fluctuation in total outstanding loan amounts, with a notable decrease in July followed by an increase surpassing June's figures.
-	Provided insights through pie charts showing the percentage distribution of Delinquent and Written-off loans relative to current loans.
-	Examined loan statuses across different channels, highlighting the absence of retail loan information.

[Home Credit Default Risk Prediction (SQL, Machine Learning, Python)](https://github.com/shuchangliang/Projects/blob/master/Home%20Credit%20Default%20Risk.ipynb)
-	Calculated credit-to-income ratio, average income, numbers of bad debt and refused accounts, etc. for 300,000 records using SQL.
-	Prepared data by removing empty records and imputing missing values, and identified features correlated to defaulted accounts.
-	Transformed categorical variables into dummy variables using one-hot encoding.
-	Implemented and compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, the performance of the later method was improved by 17%.
